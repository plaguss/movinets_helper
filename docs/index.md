# MoViNets helper

This package contains some code gathered while dealing with [MoViNets](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/movinet).
If you read through the [movinet_tutorial.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/projects/movinet/tools/plot_movinet_video_stream_predictions.ipynb) but feel like you could get some extra help to use the model for your own data, this may be useful.
